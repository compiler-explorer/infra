# Blue-Green Deployment - User Guide

This document describes how to use the blue-green deployment system, which is now available for all major environments.

## Overview

Blue-green deployment is available for the following environments:
- **Beta**: `beta-blue` and `beta-green` ASGs
- **Production**: `prod-blue` and `prod-green` ASGs
- **Staging**: `staging-blue` and `staging-green` ASGs
- **GPU**: `gpu-blue` and `gpu-green` ASGs
- **Windows**: `wintest-blue/green`, `winstaging-blue/green`, `winprod-blue/green` ASGs
- **AArch64**: `aarch64staging-blue/green`, `aarch64prod-blue/green` ASGs

Each environment uses the same blue-green deployment strategy with:
- Two ASGs with matching blue and green target groups
- ALB listener rule/action switching for traffic routing
- State tracking via SSM parameters

## Prerequisites

- AWS credentials with appropriate permissions
- Access to the CE CLI (`ce` command)
- Beta environment must be available

## Basic Usage

### Check Current Status

```bash
# Available for all environments
ce --env {beta|prod|staging|gpu|wintest|winstaging|winprod|aarch64staging|aarch64prod} blue-green status
```

Example output:
```
Blue-Green Status for staging:
Active Color: blue
Inactive Color: green

ASG Status:
  blue (ACTIVE):
    ASG Name: staging-blue
    Desired/Min/Max: 1/0/4
    ASG Health: 1/1 healthy
    Target Group: 1/1 healthy ‚úÖ
  green:
    ASG Name: staging-green
    Desired/Min/Max: 0/0/4
    ASG Health: 0/0 healthy
    Target Group: 0/0 healthy ‚ùì
```

### Deploy New Version

```bash
# Deploy to inactive color (automatically determined) - works for all environments
ce --env <environment> blue-green deploy

# Deploy with specific capacity
ce --env <environment> blue-green deploy --capacity 2

# Skip confirmation prompts (for automation)
ce --env <environment> blue-green deploy --skip-confirmation
```

The deployment process:
1. Identifies active (blue) and inactive (green) colors
2. Protects active ASG from scaling during deployment
3. Scales up inactive ASG with new instances
4. Waits for health checks to pass
5. Switches ALB listener rule to point to new target group
6. Cleans up and restores ASG settings

### Manual Operations

```bash
# Switch to specific color (if instances already exist)
ce --env <environment> blue-green switch green

# Rollback to previous color
ce --env <environment> blue-green rollback

# Clean up inactive ASG (scale to 0)
ce --env <environment> blue-green cleanup

# Shut down entire environment
ce --env <environment> blue-green shutdown

# Validate infrastructure setup
ce --env <environment> blue-green validate
```

## Advanced Usage

### Deployment with Existing Instances

If the inactive ASG already has instances, the system will warn you:

```
‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: The green ASG already has 1 instance(s) running!
This means you'll be switching to existing instances rather than deploying fresh ones.

If you want to:
  ‚Ä¢ Switch traffic to existing green instances ‚Üí use 'ce --env beta blue-green switch'
  ‚Ä¢ Roll back to green ‚Üí use 'ce --env beta blue-green rollback'
  ‚Ä¢ Deploy fresh instances ‚Üí run 'ce --env beta blue-green cleanup' first, then deploy

Do you want to continue with deployment to existing green instances? (yes/no):
```

### Automation-Friendly Commands

```bash
# Deploy without any confirmation prompts
ce --env <environment> blue-green deploy --skip-confirmation

# Switch without confirmation
ce --env <environment> blue-green switch green --skip-confirmation

# Shutdown without confirmation
ce --env <environment> blue-green shutdown --skip-confirmation
```

## Safety Features

### ASG Protection During Deployment

During deployment, the active ASG is protected from unwanted scaling:
- MinSize and MaxSize are temporarily set to current capacity
- Prevents CloudWatch alarms from scaling up
- Prevents autoscaling policies from scaling down
- Protection is automatically restored after deployment

### Signal Handling

If a deployment is interrupted (Ctrl+C, SIGTERM), the system:
- Detects the interruption
- Restores original ASG capacity settings
- Resets inactive ASG to min size 0
- Exits cleanly without orphaned resources

### Confirmation Prompts

Most operations require confirmation unless `--skip-confirmation` is used:
- Deployment operations
- Traffic switching
- Environment shutdown
- ASG cleanup

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### Health Check Types

The status command shows multiple health indicators:

1. **ASG Health**: EC2 instance health from ASG perspective
2. **Target Group Health**: ALB target group health status
   - ‚úÖ Healthy and receiving traffic
   - üü° Healthy but not receiving traffic (standby)
   - ‚ùå Unhealthy or failing health checks
   - ‚ùì Unknown state
3. **HTTP Health**: Direct HTTP endpoint checks (when run from admin node)

### Common Issues

#### Deployment Fails to Start
```bash
# Check if ASGs exist
ce --env <environment> blue-green validate

# Check current status
ce --env <environment> blue-green status
```

#### Health Checks Failing
```bash
# Check detailed instance information
ce --env <environment> blue-green status --detailed

# Check ASG scaling activities (replace ASG name as needed)
aws autoscaling describe-scaling-activities --auto-scaling-group-name <environment>-blue
```

#### Traffic Not Switching
```bash
# Verify ALB listener rule configuration
ce --env <environment> blue-green validate

# Check SSM parameters (replace environment as needed)
aws ssm get-parameter --name /compiler-explorer/<environment>/active-color
aws ssm get-parameter --name /compiler-explorer/<environment>/active-target-group-arn
```

### Manual Recovery

If something goes wrong, you can manually reset:

```bash
# Scale down both ASGs (replace environment as needed)
aws autoscaling set-desired-capacity --auto-scaling-group-name <environment>-blue --desired-capacity 0
aws autoscaling set-desired-capacity --auto-scaling-group-name <environment>-green --desired-capacity 0

# Reset SSM parameters to known state
aws ssm put-parameter --name /compiler-explorer/<environment>/active-color --value blue --overwrite

# Start fresh
ce --env <environment> blue-green deploy --capacity 1
```

## Environment Lifecycle

### Typical Workflow

1. **Normal Operation**: One color active, other inactive
2. **Deploy New Version**: Scale up inactive, switch traffic
3. **Verify Deployment**: Check status and health
4. **Cleanup**: Scale down old version (optional)
5. **Next Deployment**: Process repeats with colors swapped

### Environment Shutdown

For cost savings or maintenance:

```bash
# Shutdown entire environment
ce --env <environment> blue-green shutdown

# Restart when needed
ce --env <environment> blue-green deploy --capacity 1
```

### Long-term Maintenance

```bash
# Periodic cleanup of inactive instances
ce --env <environment> blue-green cleanup

# Validate infrastructure health
ce --env <environment> blue-green validate
```

## Integration with Existing Workflows

### Build and Deploy

```bash
# Set the version to deploy
ce --env <environment> builds set_current <version>

# Deploy using blue-green strategy
ce --env <environment> blue-green deploy
```

### Monitoring Integration

The blue-green system integrates with existing monitoring:
- CloudWatch metrics for both ASGs
- ALB target group health monitoring
- SSM parameter change events

## Best Practices

1. **Always check status** before performing operations
2. **Use cleanup regularly** to avoid resource waste
3. **Validate infrastructure** after infrastructure changes
4. **Monitor health checks** during deployments
5. **Keep deployments small** for easier rollback
6. **Use skip-confirmation** in automation only
7. **Test rollback procedures** periodically

## Environment-Specific Notes

### Windows Environments (wintest, winstaging, winprod)
- Have longer health check grace periods (300s-500s)
- WinProd supports mixed instances and auto-scaling

### AArch64 Environments (aarch64staging, aarch64prod)
- Use custom SQS queue-based auto-scaling
- Target: 3 messages per instance

### GPU Environment
- Uses mixed instances (g4dn.xlarge, g4dn.2xlarge)
- CPU-based auto-scaling enabled

## Limitations

- Requires manual capacity planning for most environments
- Health checks must pass before traffic switch
- No gradual traffic shifting (atomic switch only)
- AArch64 environments require SQS queue monitoring for scaling

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include:
- Intentional shutdown state tracking
- Enhanced monitoring capabilities
- Canary deployment support
- Automated testing integration
